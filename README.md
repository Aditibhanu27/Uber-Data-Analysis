# Uber Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project on Uber ride data. The project focuses on exploring ride patterns, booking categories, purposes, peak hours, distances, and other insightful trends using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Uber's dataset to extract valuable insights that can help understand customer behavior, optimize ride-sharing strategies, and enhance service delivery. This includes:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the raw dataset
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Creating visualizations to identify usage trends
- Summarizing key findings and business implications

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)

## Dataset
